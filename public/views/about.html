<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I've been developing programs since school and I've always enjoyed it.</p>
<p>First there were Visual Basic and Delphi. After the high school graduation I started a project on Java with plans to sell it, but it was too complicated for someone without any knowledge of good architecture, so I never finished it.</p>
<p>In university we studied C++ and Assembler, there was a course about object oriented programming which blew my mind. We also implemented few difficult cryptographic algorithms, since my speciality was information security.</p>
<p>Then I got a job as CMS developer on PHP, spent more than 2 years on it. We extended default modules and made our own. There were separate departments for JavaScript and markup, so I got almost no frontend experience there.</p>
<p>My second job wasn't so backend-focused, I was one of few developers on the projects and participated in everything. Still I didn't learn how awesome frontend could be.</p>
<p>Finally, I got my third job where my backend skills weren't in demand, so I had to switch to frontend completely, and it changed my life.</p>
<p>I am hooked on JavaScript. Ever since I took a peek at the mechanics of JS I've found all the class-based languages not flexible enough and with too much special syntax. Among all frameworks of JS I find Angular to be the best and the most awesome.</p>
<p>My current project is a dream, I develop flexible AngularJS modules for future use and it feels like I actually leave some legacy behind and my work matters. I also have to keep up with latest features of AngularJS and JavaScript, which are very interesting, I feel kinda like pioneer even.</p>
